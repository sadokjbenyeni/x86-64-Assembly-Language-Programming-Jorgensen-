1) Explain the difference between concurrency and parallel processing.
    Both imply the use of several processers while in the case of concurrency these processors could be independant, in the other case of parallel processing they are working together.

2) Name the two common approaches to parallel computations.
    Either each execute on a seprate process or both share the same process

3) In distributed processing, where might the parallel computations take place?
    In different computers connected by a network

4) Provide the names of two examples of large distributed computing projects. Include a one-sentence description of each.
    Albert@home, DreamLab (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_volunteer_computing_projects)

5) In multiprocessing, where might the parallel computations take place?
    On memory

6) Provide one advantage and one disadvantage of the distributed computing approach to parallel processing.
    Many resources to solve one problem/ Limitation of communication through a network

7) Provide one advantage and one disadvantage of the multiprocessing approach to parallel processing.
    Fast communication between processes and threads/ Limitation of number of cores or resources

8) Explain what a race condition is.
    A race condition is a set of rules followed by threads when they are working on the same project

9) Will a race condition occur when a shared variable is read by multiple simultaneously executing threads?
    No

10) Will a race condition occur when a shared variable is written by multiple simultaneously executing threads (without any coordination)?
    Yes
