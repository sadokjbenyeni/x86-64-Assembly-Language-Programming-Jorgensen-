1) What are the two main actions of a function call?
    - Linkage and Argument Transmission.

2) What are the two instructions that implement linkage?
    - call and ret

3) When arguments are passed using values, it is referred to as?
    - Call by value

4) When arguments are passed using addresses, it is referred to as?
    - Call by reference

5) If a function is called fifteen (15) times, how many times is the code placed in memory by the assembler?
    - 1 time

6) What happens during the execution of a call instruction (two things)?
    - Place contents of the rip register on the stack/ Recall that the rip register points to the next instruction to be executed 

7) According to the standard calling convention, as discussed in class, what is the purpose of the initial pushes and final pops within most procedures?
    - Save and restore the contents of the callee preserved registers

8) If there are six (6) 64-bit integer arguments passed to a function, where specifically should each of the arguments be passed?
    - They should be passed to 6 registers: rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9

9) If there are six (6) 32-bit integer arguments passed to a function, where specifically should each of the arguments be passed?
    - They should be passed to 3 registers: edi, esi, edx, ecx, r8d, r9d

10) What does it mean when a register is designated as temporary?
    - It means that he is preserved across a function call

11) Name two temporary registers?
    - Two of: rax, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, and r11.

12) What is the name for the set of items placed on the stack as part of a function call?
    - Call frame, function call frame, or activation record.

13) What does it mean when a function is referred to as a leaf function?
    - A function that is referred to as a leaf function is a function that does not call another function

14) What is the purpose of the add rsp, <immediate> after the call statement?
    - clear passed arguments

15) If three arguments are passed on the stack, what is the value for the <immediate>?
    - number of arguments * 8

16) If there are seven (7) arguments passed to a function, and the function itself pushes the rbp, rbx, and r12 registers (in that order), what is the correct offset of the stack-based argument when using the standard calling convention?
    - rbp + 16

17) What, if any, is the limiting factor for how many times a function can be called?
    - Memory size

18) If a function must return a result for the variable sum, how should the sum variable be passed (call-by-reference or call-by-value)?
    - Call by reference 

19) If there are eight (8) arguments passed to a function, and the function itself pushes the rbp, rbx, and r12 registers (in that order), what are the correct offsets for each of the two stack-based arguments (7th and 8th) when using the standard calling convention?
    - rbp + 16 and rbp + 24 respectively

20) What is the advantage of using stack dynamic local variables (as opposed to using all global variables)?
    - Less memory usage
