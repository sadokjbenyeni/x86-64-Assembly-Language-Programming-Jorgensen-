1) When stack buffer overflow is caused deliberately as part of an attack it is referred as what?
    Stack smashing

2) What does it mean when a C function is considered unsafe?
    In the function does not test against potential attacks

3) Is a program that reads user input still vulnerable if the input buffer is sufficiently large (e.g., >1024 bytes)?
    Yes

4) How might an attacker determine if an interactive program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack?
    Typing Significantly more characters than expected

5) What is a “NOPslide”?
    Is a sequence of NOP (no-operation) instructions meant to "slide" the CPU's instruction execution flow to its final, desired destination whenever the program branches to a memory address anywhere on the slide.

6) The text example injected code to open a new shell. Provide at least one different idea for injected code that would cause problems.
    Enter excessive data through shell as hex values to override the value of rip

7) Name three techniques designed to prevent stack buffer overflow attacks.
    Canaries, data execution prevention, data address space layout randomization
