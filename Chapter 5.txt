1) What is the relationship between assembly language and machine language?
    - Assembly language is what the programmer writes which will be transfomed into machine language through several steps.

2) What actions are performed on the first pass of the assembler?
    - Create symbol table, expand macros, evaluate constant expressions.

3) What actions are performed on the second pass of the assembler?
    - Final generation of code, creation of list file, create object file.

4) What actions are performed by the linker?
    - Combine one or more object files into a single executable.

5) What actions are performed by the loader?
    - Load the program from secondary storage into the primary storage. 

6) Provide an example of a constant expression.
    - dVar db 12

7) Draw a diagram of the entire assemble, link, and load process.
    - Assembly language source files(.a) -> |ASSEMBLER| -> List file + object file(.o) -> |LINKER| -> executable files(.exe) -> |LOADER| -> Loaded in ram + shared object files (.dll)

8) When is a shared object file linked with a program?
    - Before loading the execuatable in RAM

9) What is contained in the symbol table (two things)?
    - Variable names and their respective addresses
