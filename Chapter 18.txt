1) List the floating-point registers.
    16 XMM registers, xmm0 through xmm15

2) How many bytes are used by single precision floating-point values and how many bytes are used for double precision floating-point values?
    32 bits by single precision and 64 bits by double precision

3) Explain why 0.1 added 10 times does not equal 1.0.
    Cumulative rounding error associated with the inexact representation of 0.1 in binary.

4) Where is the result of a value returning floating-point function such as sin(x) returned?
    xmm0 

5) For a value returning floating-point function, which floating-point registers must be preserved across the function call?
    None is preserved
