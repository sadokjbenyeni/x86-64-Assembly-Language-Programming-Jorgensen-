1) What software entity is responsible for parsing or reading the command line arguments?
    The operating system

2) What software entity is responsible for verifying or checking the command line arguments?
    The program

3) What is the first command line argument?
    The program name

4) Explain what argc and argv refer to.
    The number of arguments and the address to list of the variables (string) respectively

5) In an assembly language program, where is argc passed to the program?
    rdi

6) In an assembly language program, where is argv passed to the program?
    rsi

7) If seven spaces are entered between each of the command line arguments, how are the spaces removed when the command line arguments are checked?
     The spaces are removed by the operating system so the program does not have to do anything.

8) If a number is expected as a command line argument, and the user enters “12x3” (an invalid value), is an error generated by the operating system (i.e., the loader)? 
    No. The program is required to check and determine if that is an error.
