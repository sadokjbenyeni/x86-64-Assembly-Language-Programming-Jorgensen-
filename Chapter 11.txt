1) Where is the macro definition placed in the assembly language source file?
    - On top of the file

2) When a macro is invoked, how many times is the code placed in the code segment?
    - As many times as the macro gets invoked

3) Explain why, in a macro, labels are typically preceded by a %% (double percent sign).
    - To avoid confusion if the macro is invoked more than one time

4) Explain what might happen if the %% is not included on a label?
    - The assembler might think that the label is a macro and will go looking for its definition

5) Is it legal to jump to a label that does not include the %%? If not legal, explain why. If legal, explain under what circumstances that might be useful.
    - It is legal and might be useful to call a macro from another or to exit the macro to go back to the main program 

6) When does the macro argument substitution occur? 
    - During assemble time
