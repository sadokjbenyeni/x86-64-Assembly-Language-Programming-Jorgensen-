1) How is the debugger started (from the commandline)?
    - ddd <program>

2) What option is required during the assemble and link step in order to ensure the program be easily debugged.
    - -g dwarf2

3) What does the run command do specifically?
    - Execute the program to the first breakpoint

4) What does the continue command do specifically?
    - Continue execution to the next breakpoint

5) How is the register window displayed?
    - Status -> Registers

6) There are three columns in the register window. The first shows the register. What do the other two columns show?
    - The content of the register in hex and unsigned hex respectively.

7) Once the debugger is started, how can the user exit?
    - with command: quit (q)

8) Describe how a break point is set (multiple ways).
    - Right click and set breakpoint on the line number or in console using either the label or the line number: break <label>/ break <line number> 

9) What is the debugger command to read debugger commands from a file?
    - source <filename>

10) When the DDD shows a green arrow pointing to an instruction, what does that mean?
    - Current location of the process

11) Provide the debugger command to display each of the following variables in decimal.
bVar1 (byte sized variable)                         u/db &bVar1
wVar1 (word sized variable)                         u/dw &wVar1
dVar1 (double-word sized variable)                  u/dd &dVar1
qVar1 (quadword sized variable)                     u/dq &qVar1
bArr1 (30 element array of bytes)                   u/30db &bArr1
wArr1 (50 element array of words)                   u/50dw &wArr1
dArr1 (75 element array of double-words)            u/75dd &dArr1

12) Provide the debugger command to display each of the following variables in hexadecimal format.
bVar1 (byte sized variable)                         x/db &bVar1
wVar1 (word sized variable)                         x/dw &wVar1
dVar1 (double-word sized variable)                  x/dd &dVar1
qVar1 (quadword sized variable)                     x/dq &qVar1
bArr1 (30 element array of bytes)                   x/30db &bArr1
wArr1 (50 element array of words)                   x/50dw &wArr1
dArr1 (75 element array of double-words)            x/75dd &dArr1

13) What is the debugger command to display the value at the current top of the stack?
    x/ug  $rsp


14) What is the debugger command to display five (5) values at the current top of the stack?
    x/5ug  $rsp
