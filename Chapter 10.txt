1) What is an algorithm?
    - An unambiguous, ordered sequence of steps involved in solving a problem.

2) What are the four main steps in algorithm development?
    - Understand the Problem/Create the Algorithm/Implement the Program/Test/Debug the Program

3) Are the four main steps in algorithm development applicable only to assembly language programming?
    - No, any programming language

4) What type of error, if any, occurs if the one operand multiply instruction uses an immediate value operand? Respond with assemble-time or run-time.
    - Assemble-time

5) If an assembly language instruction is spelled incorrectly (e.g., “mv” instead of “mov”), when will the error be found? Respond with assemble-time or run-time.
    - Assemble-time

6) If a label is referenced, but not defined, when will the error be found? Respond with assemble-time or run-time.
    - Assemble-time

7) If a program performing a series of divides on values in an array divides by 0, when will the error be found? Respond with assemble-time or run-time.
    - Run-time
