1) What is the statement to declare the functions, func1() and func2(), as external assuming no arguments are needed for either function?
    extern func1()  
    extern func2()

2) What is the statement to declare the functions, func1() and func2(), as external if two integer arguments are used for each function?
    extern func1(int a, int b)
    extern func2(int a, int b)

3) What will happen if an external function is called but is not declared as external?
    An error will be generated

4) If an externally declared function is called but the programmer did not actually write the function, when would the error be flagged, assemble-time, link-time, or run-time?
    Assemble-time

5) If the “-g” option is omitted from the assemble and link commands, would the program be able to execute?
    Yes, but not able to debug
