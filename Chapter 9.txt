1.Which register refers to the top of the stack?
    - rsp

2.What happens as a result of a push rax instruction (two things)?
    - First, rsp = rsp - 8 and then rax register is copied to [rsp] (in that order).

3.How many bytes of data does the pop rax instruction remove from the stack?
    - 8 bytes

4.Given the following code fragment:
    mov     r10
    mov     r11
    mov     r12
    push    r10 
    push    r11 
    push    r12 
    pop     r10
    pop     r11 
    pop     r12     ;r10:  0x0000 0000 0000 0003       r11:  0x0000 0000 0000 0002      r12:  0x0000 0000 0000 0001
What would be in the r10 , r11, and r12 registers after execution? Show answer in hex, full register size.

5.Provide one advantage to the stack growing downward in memory.
    The array is reversed in memory.
