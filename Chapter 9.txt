1.Which register refers to the top of the stack?
    - rsp

2.What happens as a result of a push rax instruction (two things)?
    - rax value assigned on rsp current position then rsp decremented by value of 8(bytes)

3.How many bytes of data does the pop rax instruction remove from the stack?
    - 8 bytes
4.Given the following code fragment:
    mov     r10, 1 
    mov     r11, 2 
    mov     r12, 3 
    push    r10 
    push    r11 
    push    r12 
    pop     r10
    pop     r11 
    pop     r12     ;r10: 3       r11: 2      r12: 1
What would be in the r10 , r11, and r12 registers after execution? Show answer in hex, full register size.

5.Provide one advantage to the stack growing downward in memory.
Efficient use of memory
